# My First Post: A Feature Test

This post is a demonstration of all the formatting capabilities available in a GitHub Pages blog using Jekyll and Markdown. We will cover everything from basic text formatting to advanced embeds.

This text is **bold** and this text is *italic*. It's easy to add emphasis wherever you need it.

## Lists and Organization

Sometimes you need to organize information into lists.

**An Unordered List:**
- Item one
- Item two
  - A nested item
- Item three

**An Ordered List:**
1. First, we do this.
2. Second, we do that.
3. Finally, we are done.

## Adding Images

Yes, you can absolutely add an image. First, upload the image file to your repository (a good practice is to create an `assets/images` folder). Then, link to it like this:

## Displaying Code Snippets

Displaying code is crucial for a technical blog. Here is a sample Python function with proper syntax highlighting.

```python
# A simple function to greet a user
def greet(name):
  """This function takes a name and prints a greeting."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the blog.")

# Let's call the function
greet("World")
```
